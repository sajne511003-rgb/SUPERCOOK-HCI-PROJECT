# SUPERCOOK-HCI-PROJECT

1. Project Overview
SuperCook is a coded, working smartphone application developed to address the "cognitive friction" beginner cooks experience when dealing with complex terminology or missing ingredients. The project follows the iterative HCI design lifecycle to ensure an inclusive and resilient digital solution for its target users.

2. Fully Functional MVP App 
- Platform Notes: This application has been optimized and tested for Android phones.

3. MVP Must-Have Features
The following features were prioritized as "Must-Haves" in Task 1 and have been fully implemented in this high-fidelity prototype:
- Interactive Recipe Finder: Allows users to find beginner-friendly recipes.
- Instant Ingredient Substitution: A "Swap" feature to handle missing items, justified by Fitts' Law for high efficiency.
- Terminology Help: Integrated help for cooking terms to support the Simple and Intuitive Use principle of Universal Design.

4. AI Tool Disclosure
In accordance with course requirements, the project team discloses the use of the following AI tools:

- VO Dev: Used for generating high-fidelity code structures and interface logic.
- Gemini AI (Google): Utilized for brainstorming design rationales, structuring report sections, and clarifying HCI theoretical concepts.
- ChatGPT: Assisted in drafting descriptive error messages and interface text for the final prototype.
Verification: All usability testing, data collection from 5 participants, and primary design decisions were conducted independently by the project team.
